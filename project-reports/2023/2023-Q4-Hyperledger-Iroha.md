# Maintainer Diversity

Currently, the Iroha 2 core development team consists of:

* 9 Rust developers
* 2 full-time QA engineers
* 2 full-time technical writers
* 1 community manager
* 1 project manager
* 1 DevOps

The maintenance team is currently comprised of SORAMITSU employees. [Gregorz Bazior](https://github.com/baziorek) (Yonix Digital Systems, AGH University of Science and Technology) is interested in Iroha 2 and maintains Iroha 1.

# Contributor Diversity

The practice of working with interns has been established and will continue.
We've got some interest from a potential security-oriented intern and we're in the process of discussing the topics to tackle.
