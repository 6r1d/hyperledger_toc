    class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><span>Minutes</span></a> from
    May 18th meeting

  - Need more work in requirements and use cases around lifecycles of
    identities, will be working on some docs to share with those WGs

  - Variety of discussions around possible technologies being deployed
    elsewhere with real relevance

  - Selective disclosure and different approaches was a hot topic for
    the group

  - May need different identity services and determine what APIs would
    be needed

  - Tomorrow is big UN conference on digiital identity
    <a href="http://www.weboftrust.info/" class="external-link"
    rel="nofollow"><span>http://www.weboftrust.info/</span></a>

  - Jeremy S: we came up with list of potential use cases and will be
    reaching out to Oleg to see how it maps in.  As we getting a better
    sense of dimensions of layers of system -- helps to have a common
    language to separate out some of these things.

  - - Christopher A:  conflation in a variety of areas.  Different
      identity communities call “key holders” vs. “principals”... need
      to reconcile some terminology issues.  Fundamental difference
      between finance and supply chain workflows. Discussed with Eric
      Anderson of Bloomberg who will be sharing with Identity workshop
      some of the use cases that Bloomberg wants to share.

- CI WG (Chris Ferris)

- - Gerrit has been stood up; need some more config and training and
    then a planned migration from Github to Gerrit
  - Jenkins is up; but still needs a small amount of confg, should be
    done early next week
  - If people want to help with CI, plenty of opportunity to volunteer

  

**Exit Criteria Discussion** \[thank you to Alice Ma and Bill for the
notes below!\]

- Project must have cultivated a diverse set of contributing members

- - One of the most important factors
  - Ensure that membership is \> 1
  - Diversity includes diversity of usage, e.g.: companies that use the
    technology and servicing the technology. We shouldn't just measure
    the contributions, we need to take into account the types sizes of
    companies that can deploy solutions

- Must demonstrate some threshold of test coverage.

- -     Some sections of the codebase are more important to cover than
    others (crypto, security)

  -     We need a yardstick to measure this beyond "we always need more
    (tests)"

  -     What's a reasonable % of test coverage?

  - - Hard to say because it's different at different levels:

    - - security stuff: upper 90's
      - business logic: 5 lines of test per 10 000lines of code (?)

    - Further discussion required

- Scalability

- - Which dimensions?
  - Is this idea related to scale of use in real world?

-  Appropriateness of requirements met by MVP

- - Concern: Given that running code wins, is there a risk in putting
    too many requirements?

  - - Programming practices of security world are difficult to do in an
      agile way BUT there's still value to the agile paradigm. When it
      comes to business logic, we could do better than Ethereum smart
      contracts (15 serious errors per 1000)
    - HOWEVER: Contracts/chain code (except for samples) are not quite
      what we're doing
    - STILL, some things need to be strong, so we do need a high bar
      (e.g. identity/IBM's new crypto system using keys in a new form)

- Project must have real world use

- - Use by a small supply chain/something that is "real "in some fashion
    is a criteria for being mature

  - Real problems: does the code fit into the regulatory requirement?

  - - Test ledgers perpetually running?
    - Less rigorous definition

  - Refinement period is necessary for all OS projects:

  - - Ledgers cannot be treated like a service package. Needs to be
      cross-autonomizationservice?
    - Can incubate DNS bind and understand how it works as a package
    - Other projects had continually running test pads to verify
      cross-organization consistency: not a full-blown production
      systems

  - May need to know whether or not it's "transaction-ready"

  - - Has it been audited/blessed by security/crypto community
    - Has it been used by a regulator
    - Ensure that there's enough disclaimers so that there's no
      misunderstandings/legal trouble

- What does "maturity" and "incubation" mean from a community
  perspective?

- - Should discuss this further outside of the call.

  - Definition of "mature": is there a separate interpretation of
    maturity within the Hyperledger organization (vs the interpretation
    within other OS communities)

  - Just because something is out of incubation doesn't mean it's not
    incubating anymore. It means that it's at its beginning, and that
    more tests and functionality can be added

  - Should there be a level in between "mature" and "incubating"?  Or
    should this be handled by levels of release? (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc)

  - Does "mature" really mean "mature enough to rely on it in some
    fashion"?

  - Proposed definition of "incubation" and "maturity" – "maturity"
    means that we have agreed that this thing is something we're going
    to continue to support and develop

  - - "Anchor points": both terms reference a project's participation in
      the final release of the code base, not in terms of maturity or
      use of the code IRL

  - Input from someone (name?):

  - - The "incubation" label is like "beta"
    - Considerations: Has this project/module proven capable of
      releases? People maintaining, debugging as necessary, security
      patches
    - Look to Apache incubator for how other OSF's do this (they don't
      require proof of production use)

- Sufficient documentation

- - Should be enough for anyone to test/deploy any of the modules.
    Documentation should illustrate test cases, demonstrate various test
    cases

- Input from Christopher Allen:

- - We haven't had discussion on:

  - - Multiple identity system
    - Pluggable architecture
    - E.g.: Hyperledger would only have 1 "master" codebase, future
      iterations will have to reconcile with existing ones

  - Does one version of a module need to be compatible with existing
    mature versions for it to be considered "mature"?

- Other Concerns

- - Slack channel: archived messages can't be seen
  - Modes of communication/collaboration: slack, email, conference calls
  - If we want to use slack, then maybe we should consider getting an
    enterprise version
  - Todd and Brian to have a conversation about what we can do to fix
