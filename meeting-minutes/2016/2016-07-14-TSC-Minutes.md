  (Arnaud Le Hors)

- - Cleaned up document and incorporated in feedback

  - Bills email:  <a

  - - CF:  Thinking on deprecation part is that project maintainers
      would make that recommendation and it would go through period of
      dormancy while it is still being actively supported (no new
      feature developments, however).  Do we only address critical vulns
      or merging of bug fixes too? After a period of time, 6 months or 1
      year, it could be completely archived. Think TSC should get
      involved in process just from awareness standpoint.

    - Jeremy:  Fear this proposal is a little complex.  Would like to
      connect with Bill offline to iterate.

    - CF:  As a function of software that we release being suitable in a
      variety of contexts, depending on domain (i.e. healthcare), has
      the Hyperledger Project done the due diligence to be able to
      assert that the software is suitable.  Various levels of
      certification that can be used? The work done by Bill/Jeremey is
      great in terms of maturity of software. Potentially the term
      “mature” is what people are getting hung up on. May need another
      term for a project that is not “incubation” and not “archived.”

    - ALH:  ASF uses TLP.  Maybe something more along those lines?

    - BrianB:  Top-level, active, or stable may be the best terms.

    - RGB:  Stable sounds like “no further development”

    - CF:  Write-up is about process of creating the software, not the
      actual software itself.  When we get to nomenclature of releases,
      this will be more important. Thoughts on stable or active for
      project?

    - CONSENSUS:  Active

    - - ACTION:  Take table and Bill’s proposal and consolidate into doc
        to talk about maturity of software itself (Arnaud)
      - ACTION:  Adjust exit criteria using term “active” and bring
        forward for approval next week (Arnaud)
      - ACTION:  Update Project LIfecycle and other reference documents
        to use term “Active” (Arnaud)

- Technical Community to review, add comments, and iterate on the
  Hyperledger Release Taxonomy <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9pt-bXeOXefYBB1uYE6M-D6CtmkC1lGCjmicSlZgVA/edit"
  class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><span>v0.1</span></a>.  (Brian
  Behlendorf)

- - Likes semantic versioning specification, let’s take one more week to
    look at semver.  Look at next week to adopting for Hyperledger.

- Initial <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16z3lcdLjYwRkSrcq0hlXc62zi-QPAdPjvfvIy-b48jA/edit"
  class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><span>draft</span></a> to
  establish process, timeline, and criteria for electing the steady
  state TSC and TSC Chair

- - CF:  Propose that for year one, contributors equal code,
    documentation (some work like requirements wg, whitepaper wg), would
    also count contributions on exit criteria.  Would like to extend to
    people contributing to WGs. Are there any objections to this?
  - BB:  very supportive of taking broad view of who is a “contributor”
    -- anyone who has made a contribution of intellectual value.  Can
    tighten this up over time. We are in a community building phase,
    would like to see big tent.
  - VOTE:  Approved.  7 of 8 yes (Stefan did not vote, possibly due to
    audio line).  For this first election of TSC only, definition of
    contributor is more broad to also include contributions to the WGs
    and Exit Criteria.

  

**W3C Workshop update (Arnaud Le Hors)**

- Arnaud provided an overview of the W3C workshop, noting that a more
  formal report is underway and will get shared out once complete.

  

**Hyperledger Explorer Proposal (Konrad Pabjan and Vaniprasad Kommera)**

- Present overview and demo of Hyperledger Explorer <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AqDmhfmAAOsQJm923xe8iPHNt0TIF79WERPiIEFGJCI/edit"
  class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><span>Proposal</span></a>

- Discussion

- - CF:  This is an awesome start, would like others to collaborate and
    contribute on this.
  - Brian B:   It also sounds like there may be a similar offering from
    IBM, detaching their Bluemix-based console from Bluemix and making
    it stand-alone.  Can I suggest that both efforts be combined into a
    new project, in a repository separate from the main Fabric
    repository (and thus able to set their own committer base, release
    schedule, etc) combining the best of both?
  - Tamas:  Will you contribute after you push the code?
  - Konrad:  At DTCC, there will be full-time individuals to take over
    this work.
  - Brian B:  When we take a new project in, we are partly evaluating
    what the project does, but also the team.  If IBM may open source
    and contribute explorer, there is a great opportunity to create a
    project that sits separate from Fabric and could talk to other
    projects (i.e. STL).  Important to identify who contributors are,
    moving forward. Can we get together DTCC & IBM put heads together to
    create a joint proposal here?
  - Murali:  Committed to this, also taking up Java chaincode.  If
    everyone is in agreement on Explorer, we can work with IBM.
  - CF:  IBM his happy to collaborate around concept of explorer.  Need
    to do some digging, as this was something developed by the Bluemix
    team, not the Blockchain team.  Need to connect with that group and
    see how interested they are with open sourcing it.
  - CF:  Start an explorer project and then have first project be Fabric
    explorer?  And if that can become more generally useful, we can
    rename.
  - Brian B:  How about start as Hyperledger-Explorer with premise that
    team is free to connect with others (i.e. STL).  Don’t need to be
    early binding on this, can be late binding.
  - Tamas:  If it is using concepts of Fabric, chaincode…. It should be
    put there.  Either we make it more generic, or we keep it with
    Fabric.
  - CF:  Dan, would Intel be willing to help with this for STL?
  - DM:  Yes. <a
    href="http://intelledger.github.io/sawtooth_developers_guide/web_api/index.html"
    class="external-link"
    rel="nofollow"><span>http://intelledger.github.io/sawtooth_developers_guide/web_api/index.html</span></a>
  - CF:  Let’s take a step back, how do we deal with multiples of the
    same thing.  This is currently in your personal repo? While we could
    fork it, since you last day is tomorrow, don’t want to lose.
  - Konrad:  Will be pushing code to Satish and then can push to master
    on HLP.  Satish will have full control.
  - Brian B:  Ok, if it is Apache 2.0, we can accept it later.
  - Konrad:  when I push code, should I push to fabric or to separate
    one?
  - CF:  We’ll want to work with Satish in terms of getting merged in. 
    We could merge into Fabric, but that creates a different set of
    problem.  For now, push it to Satish and make sure licensing is
    covered appropriately.  And then we can bring it in as a separate
    repo for this to evolve. Satish can handle.
  - ACTION:  Revise Hyperledger Explorer proposal and bring back to the
    TSC next week for review/approval.
