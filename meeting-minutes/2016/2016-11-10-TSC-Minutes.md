**Agenda**

- Action Item Review
- Sawtooth Lake: Marketplace Navigator has been added to the
  sawtooth-core <a

  class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><span>repository</span></a>. (Dan

- HIP:  Cello (Baohua Yang)

  

**Action Item Review**

- Cancel 11/24 TSC meeting due to US Thanksgiving)

- - No objections.

- 11/17 TSC meeting -- Chris and Brian are both out.  Does another TSC
  member want to run the meeting?

- - Please let us know via email.

- December Hackfest - still searching for a host/venue for December 5th
  & 6th

- - Getting clarity on 2 final venue options by Tuesday EOD, otherwise
    we will need to cancel the December Hackfest -- unless folks here
    have options to provide.  Please get in touch ASAP if so.

- TSC and technical community to review <a
  href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/project-incubation-exit-criteria"
  rel="nofollow"><span>Project Incubation Exit Criteria</span></a> and
  make any pertinent updates to be able to come to consensus on November
  10th TSC meeting.

- - Questions raised that code review is probably not best way to asses
    security, need some other way to state a security/crypto analysis. 
    Need a framework in place to be able to analyze security.
  - Don’t want excessive requirements before something exits incubation,
    find some level of middle ground.
  - Brian noted that Hyperledger is looking to hire a Security Maven to
    help with this process.
  - Comment was made that there is a struggle with notion of “project”
    maturity level as opposed to “product” maturity level.  Exit
    criteria is really a way to determine that it is a functioning
    community, not that code is bulletproof and getting into product
    maturity.
  - Suggestion made to drop “additional requirements” portion of
    document.
  - Projects \_should\_ be thinking about that section, but not have it
    set up as a barrier.  Maybe rename it as “additional considerations”
  - Move additional discussion on this topic to TSC list, look to take a
    vote next week.

- China Technical WG update

- - No update -- coming soon.
  - A suggestion was made to have a mechanism to prevent any fracturing
    of the global Community.

- Internship Program

- - Potential interest to sponsor and pay for 6 Hyperledger interns,
    similar to <a href="https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Interns"
    class="external-link"
    rel="nofollow">https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Interns</a>.

  - TSC and technical community responded to this with positive support.

  - - Potential mentors:  Dan to find someone from STL, Mark Wagner to
      find mentors at Red Hat, Leonard Edwin to help, as well.
    - If you are interested in being a mentor, please let us know.

  

**Sawtooth Lake: Marketplace Navigator has been added to the
sawtooth-core** <a
href="https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/extensions/mktplace/navigator"
class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><strong>repository</strong></a>**.
(Dan Middleton)**

- MarketPlace Navigator is a hosted UI for the MarketPlace Transaction
  Family. It consists of three major pieces: a single page app, a server
  backend, and a syncing tool for synchronizing block state with the
  navigator's database.
- The single page app is a ClojureScript app (with some plain JavaScript
  dependencies), which provides client-side transaction signing
  capabilities. A user of the system generates a WIF key in the browser,
  which they can save locally. A user can create most MarketPlace
  objects via the UI, including participants, assets, holdings and sell
  offers.
- The server is a Node.js application, which uses RethinkDB for its
  storage needs. It provides API's to create richer representation of
  the marketplace objects, in order to improve the user experience. It
  also acts as a pass-through for transactions being submitted to a
  validator. Any transaction successfully submitted will be recorded,
  giving history of any failures that may occur during block
  construction.
- The synchronization tool is a python script that bridges the gap
  between block store contents and a RethinkDB database instance. It
  reads block deltas from a validator, and creates block store
  snapshots, essentially providing an immutable history of the block
  state.
